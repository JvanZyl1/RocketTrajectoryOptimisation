%These instructions give you guidelines for preparing papers for AIAA Technical Papers using \LaTeX{}. Define all symbols used in the abstract. Do not cite references in the abstract. The footnote on the first page should list the Job Title and AIAA Member Grade for each author, if known Authors do not have to be AIAA members.
% Do not cite references in abstract.

% The abstract should appear at the beginning of your paper. It should be one paragraph long (not an introduction) and complete in itself (no reference numbers). It should indicate subjects dealt with in the paper and state the objectives of the investigation. Newly observed facts and conclusions of the experiment or argument discussed in the paper must be stated in summary form; readers should not have to read the paper to understand the abstract. The abstract should be bold, indented 3 picas (1/2'') on each side, and separated from the rest of the document by blank lines above and below the abstract text..
