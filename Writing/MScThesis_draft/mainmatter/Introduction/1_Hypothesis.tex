Robustness is defined in this work as the minimum performance for the control system to function in a practical environment (\cite{ZHANG201041}). Robust control design results in stable controls within bounded modelling errors and uncertainties. As a data driven controller cannot have stability proven through classical methods. This study defines the outcome as robust if above minimum required performance is given in terms of accuracy under environmental disturbances, defined in \autoref{sec:metrics}. Future work can extend this to other disturbances like static parameter variations and sensor noise.
