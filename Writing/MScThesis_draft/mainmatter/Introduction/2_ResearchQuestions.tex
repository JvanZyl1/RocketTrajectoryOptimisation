This section defines the project research questions; they are written to answer the hypothesis of \autoref{sec:hypothesis}, with the metrics used to determine success denoted later in \autoref{sec:metrics}.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title={\textbf{Research question 1}}]
How can data-driven control systems be effectively applied for a rocketâ€™s high-level trajectory planning and mid-level guidance control during landing?
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title={\textbf{Research question 2}}]
What factors affect the computational feasibility of mimicking traditional trajectory planning methods, like convex optimisation, through a learnt policy?
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title={\textbf{Research question 3}}]
What level of fidelity is needed for a simulation model to provide a conceptual study into policy transferability?
\end{tcolorbox}

% Flight phase characteristics?
