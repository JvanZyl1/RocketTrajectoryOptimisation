To learn a policy for optimal landing an \textit{environment} is needed in the form of a rocket model. As this study provides aims to provide a benchmark for determining the feasibility of using policy learning to provide control to a rocket during landing, and no proprietary model is available, a new model is constructed based of physics and literature. First, to ensure a feasible landing the rocket is sized and staged through reviewing a case study rocket from industry in \autoref{sec:SpaceX} and then a paper which optimal stages a reusable rocket in \autoref{sec:OptimalStaging}. Following this an aerodynamic model is derived with parameters found from literature in \autoref{sec:Aerodynamics}, before the same with the grid fins acting as the manoeuvrable aerodynamic control surfaces in \autoref{sec:ACS}. Following this, the atmosphere and thruster models are found and derived in \autoref{sec:Atmosphere} and \autoref{sec:RocketEngines} respectively. Finally, the model is culminated into its equations of motion in \autoref{sec:EoM}.
