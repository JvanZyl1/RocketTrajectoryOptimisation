# Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) Buffer Testing and Verification

This document explains how to use the `test_buffer.py` script to verify that the PER implementation is working correctly and to fix issues with sampling weights.

## Background

Our reinforcement learning agent uses Prioritized Experience Replay (PER), which samples experiences with higher TD errors more frequently during training. This improves learning efficiency by focusing on the most informative experiences.

However, the system has a flag called `uniform_beun_fix_bool` which, when set to `True`, disables prioritized sampling and uses uniform sampling instead (with all weights = 1.0).

## Running the Test Script

To verify your PER implementation:

```bash
python test_buffer.py
```

### What the Test Does

1. **Buffer Creation**: Creates a test buffer with 10,000 random transitions
2. **Priority Generation**: Assigns increasing priorities to transitions (later entries have higher TD errors)
3. **Dual Sampling Mode**: Tests both uniform and prioritized sampling modes
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Compares and analyzes sampling patterns and weight distributions

### Expected Results

When working correctly, you should observe:

1. **For prioritized sampling**:
   - Varying importance sampling weights (not all = 1.0)
   - Higher mean index value (preferring later, high-priority transitions)
   - Weight distribution with values between 0 and 1

2. **For uniform sampling**:
   - All weights equal to 1.0
   - More uniform distribution of sampled indices
   - Lower mean index value compared to prioritized sampling

3. **Low overlap** between indices sampled with prioritized vs. uniform methods

## Example Output

Here's an example of expected output from a correctly working PER implementation:

```

```

In this example, note the following key indicators of correct operation:

- The priorities follow the expected gradient (higher for later entries)
- In prioritized mode, weights vary between 0.25 and 1.0 with a standard deviation of ~0.18
- The mean index for prioritized sampling (7856) is much higher than uniform sampling (4927)
- Only about 24% overlap between samples from the two modes
- Clear warning when uniform sampling is enabled

### Interpretation of Results:

1. **PER Implementation Status**: The test confirms that the PER implementation is **working correctly**. The buffer correctly switches between prioritized and uniform sampling modes, and the weighted sampling behavior is as expected.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - **Default Setting**: The buffer starts with `uniform_beun_fix_bool = False`, meaning prioritized sampling is enabled by default.
   - **Weight Distribution**: In prioritized mode, weights vary (min: 0.297, max: 1.0, mean: 0.346) with 501 unique weights, confirming proper importance sampling.
   - **Clear Mode Distinction**: The uniform sampling mode produces exactly 1.0 weights as expected, with a clear warning message.
   - **Sampling Bias**: The prioritized sampling has a significantly higher mean index (6140) compared to uniform sampling (4964), showing it's properly biasing toward higher-priority experiences.
   - **Very Low Overlap**: Only 5.86% overlap between prioritized and uniform sampling, which is even better than expected and confirms the two modes are functioning distinctly.

3. **Differences from Example**:
   - **Buffer Position**: The test buffer position is 0 versus 10000 in the example. This suggests the buffer wasn't fully filled, but still correctly demonstrates the sampling behavior.
   - **Lower Weights Variation**: The standard deviation (0.057) is smaller than the example (0.186), which could be due to different priority distributions.
   - **Very Low Overlap**: The actual overlap (5.86%) is much lower than the example (24.22%), suggesting even better differentiation between sampling modes.

4. **Conclusion**: The PER implementation is fundamentally sound. The warning and toggling behavior work as designed, and the weight distributions show proper prioritization. The previous issue of all weights being 1.0 was likely due to the `uniform_beun_fix_bool` flag being set to `True` elsewhere in the codebase.

## Interpreting the Results

### Prioritized Sampling is Working Correctly When:

- The "All equal to 1.0" check returns `False` for prioritized sampling
- Mean index for prioritized sampling is significantly higher than uniform sampling
- There are multiple unique weights in prioritized mode
- Weight statistics show variation (standard deviation > 0)

## Fixing Issues in a Training Environment

If you discover that your agent is using uniform sampling instead of PER during training, follow these steps to resolve the issue:

### 1. Check During Agent Creation

Add a verification step immediately after creating the agent:

```python
agent = SoftActorCritic(**config)
print(f"Initial sampling mode - Uniform: {agent.get_sampling_mode()}")
agent.use_prioritized_sampling()  # Explicitly set to prioritized
print(f"Corrected sampling mode - Uniform: {agent.get_sampling_mode()}")
```

### 2. Fix Loading Code

When loading an agent from a saved state, the `uniform_beun_fix_bool` flag might be set incorrectly. Modify your loading code:

```python
from src.agents.functions.load_agent import load_sac

# Load the agent
agent = load_sac(agent_path)

# Force prioritized sampling and verify
agent.use_prioritized_sampling()
print(f"Agent using uniform sampling: {agent.get_sampling_mode()}")
```

### 3. Add Monitoring to Training Loop

Add periodic checks within your training loop to catch if the sampling mode changes unexpectedly:

```python
# At the start of each episode or periodically
if episode % 100 == 0:
    is_uniform = agent.get_sampling_mode()
    if is_uniform:
        print("WARNING: Agent is using uniform sampling instead of PER!")
        agent.use_prioritized_sampling()
```

### 4. Examine Weight Distribution in TensorBoard

Monitor the weight distribution in TensorBoard during training. Add the following logging to your code:

```python
# Log weight stats to TensorBoard
weights_np = np.array(weights_buffer)
self.writer.add_scalar('Buffer/WeightsMean', np.mean(weights_np), self.step_idx)
self.writer.add_scalar('Buffer/WeightsStd', np.std(weights_np), self.step_idx)
self.writer.add_scalar('Buffer/WeightsAllEqual', float(np.all(weights_np == weights_np[0])), self.step_idx)
```

A properly functioning PER should show:
- Decreasing mean weight values over time (as the beta parameter anneals)
- Non-zero standard deviation
- False (0.0) for the "all equal" metric

### 5. Debug Persistence Issues

If the issue returns after fixing, it might be related to how the buffer state is saved and loaded. Ensure that your save/load code preserves the `uniform_beun_fix_bool` properly:

```python
# When saving agent state, explicitly include the flag
buffer_state = {
    'buffer': agent.buffer.buffer,
    'priorities': agent.buffer.priorities,
    'n_step_buffer': agent.buffer.n_step_buffer,
    'position': agent.buffer.position,
    'beta': agent.buffer.beta,
    'uniform_beun_fix_bool': agent.buffer.uniform_beun_fix_bool  # Add this line
}
```

## Using the Debugging Utilities

Additional utility functions are available for debugging:

```python
from src.agents.functions.debug_buffer import debug_buffer_weights, toggle_buffer_uniform_sampling

# Check buffer settings and behavior
debug_buffer_weights(agent)

# Toggle between uniform and prioritized sampling
toggle_buffer_uniform_sampling(agent)
```

## PER Settings in Your Agent

Current PER hyperparameters:
- **alpha (priority exponent)**: 0.6
- **beta (importance sampling)**: Starting at 0.4, annealed toward 1.0
- **beta_decay**: 0.99

These settings determine how strongly priorities influence sampling and how much bias correction is applied.
