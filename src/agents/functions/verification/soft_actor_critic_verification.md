# Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) Verification Tests

This document describes the verification tests for the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) implementation. The tests ensure that the SAC algorithm's core components function correctly and interact properly with each other.

## Overview

The verification tests are implemented in `soft_actor_critic_verification.py` and cover three main aspects:
1. Initialization
2. Training Cycle
3. Action Selection

## Test Components

### 1. Initialization Test
- Verifies proper initialization of the SAC agent
- Checks network structures (actor and critic)
- Validates buffer initialization
- Confirms optimizer states

### 2. Training Cycle Test
- Tests the complete training cycle including:
  - Critic warm-up step
  - Parameter updates (actor, critic, and temperature)
  - Buffer operations
  - Loss calculations
- Verifies that:
  - Actor parameters update correctly
  - Critic parameters update correctly
  - Temperature updates after the first episode
  - Batch processing works correctly

### 3. Action Selection Test
- Validates both stochastic and deterministic action selection
- Ensures actions are within expected bounds
- Verifies that stochastic and deterministic policies produce different outputs
- Checks action dimensions and shapes

## Implementation Details

### Buffer Management
- Uses batched operations for efficiency
- Properly reshapes arrays for concatenation
- Handles TD error calculations in vectorized form
- Maintains correct dimensions throughout the process

### Parameter Updates
- Tracks initial and updated parameters
- Uses tree-based comparison for structured parameters
- Implements proper floating-point comparison for temperature values
- Handles the first-step temperature update correctly

### Visualization
- Generates plots for training metrics
- Creates visualizations for action distributions
- Saves results to CSV files for analysis

## Running the Tests

To run the verification tests:

```bash
python src/agents/functions/verification/soft_actor_critic_verification.py
```

The tests will:
1. Create a test environment
2. Initialize the SAC agent
3. Run all verification tests
4. Generate visualizations
5. Save results to CSV

## Test Results

The verification suite includes 13 individual tests covering various aspects of the SAC implementation. All tests pass successfully, verifying that:

- The SAC agent initializes correctly
- Networks are structured properly
- The buffer handles experiences correctly
- Parameter updates work as expected
- Action selection functions properly
- Temperature updates occur after the first episode

## Outputs

The tests generate several outputs:
1. Training metrics plot
2. Action distribution visualization
3. CSV file with detailed test results
4. Console output with test status

All outputs are saved in:
```
results/verification/soft_actor_critic_verification/
```

## Conclusion

The verification tests confirm that the SAC implementation functions correctly and maintains the expected behaviors of the algorithm. All components work together properly, and the agent can be safely used for training.
