# TD3 (Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) Verification

## Overview
TD3 is an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that extends DDPG with several key improvements:
1. Twin Q-learning to reduce overestimation bias
2. Delayed policy updates to improve stability
3. Target policy smoothing to prevent overfitting

## Key Components

### 1. Networks
- **Actor**: A deterministic policy network that maps states to actions
- **Critic**: Twin Q-networks that estimate the value of state-action pairs
- **Target Networks**: Delayed copies of the actor and critic networks for stable learning

### 2. Experience Replay Buffer
- **Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)**: Stores transitions with priorities based on TD errors
- **Uniform Sampling**: Option to sample transitions uniformly instead of by priority
- **N-step Returns**: Computes n-step returns for better credit assignment

### 3. Learning Process
1. **Critic Warm-up**: Initial phase where only the critic is trained
2. **TD Error Calculation**: Computes temporal difference errors using twin Q-values
3. **Delayed Policy Updates**: Actor is updated less frequently than the critic
4. **Target Network Updates**: Soft updates to target networks using a mixing parameter (tau)

### 4. Key Features
- **Policy Noise**: Adds noise to actions for exploration
- **Noise Clipping**: Limits the magnitude of exploration noise
- **Gradient Clipping**: Prevents exploding gradients
- **Double Q-learning**: Uses minimum of twin Q-values to reduce overestimation

## Verification Tests

### 1. Initialization
- Verifies TD3 initialization with different network configurations
- Checks network shapes and parameter dimensions
- Tests action selection with and without noise

### 2. Action Selection
- Tests deterministic and stochastic action selection
- Verifies action bounds and noise application
- Plots action distributions for different states

### 3. Update Functions
- Tests critic and actor updates with different batch sizes
- Verifies learning rates and gradient clipping
- Plots learning curves for different hyperparameters

### 4. Buffer Control
- Tests priotised and uniform sampling modes
- Verifies buffer priority updates
- Plots weight distributions for different sampling modes

## Results
The verification script generates several plots:
1. Action distributions for different states
2. Learning curves for critic and actor losses
3. Weight distributions for different sampling modes

These plots help verify that the TD3 implementation is working correctly and maintaining stable learning dynamics.

## Usage

To run the verification tests:

```bash
python src/verification/td3_verification.py
```

The script will:
1. Create a results directory at `results/verification/td3_verification/`
2. Run all verification tests
3. Generate plots and save them to the results directory
4. Print progress and results to the console

## Expected Results

1. All initialization tests should pass with different configurations
2. Action selection should:
   - Produce actions within [-1, 1] bounds
   - Show appropriate noise application
   - Maintain consistent shapes

3. Update functions should:
   - Show decreasing losses over time
   - Demonstrate proper learning with different hyperparameters
   - Maintain stable TD errors

4. Buffer control should:
   - Show different weight distributions for uniform vs. priotised sampling
   - Demonstrate proper sampling behavior
   - Maintain consistent buffer operations

## Notes

- The verification uses fixed random seeds for reproducibility
- Tests are designed to be comprehensive but not exhaustive
- Some tests may take longer to run due to multiple configurations
- Results are saved for further analysis and comparison
