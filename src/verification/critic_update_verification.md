## Introduction

In Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), the critic network estimates the Q-values (expected future returns) for state-action pairs. The critic is updated using Temporal Difference (TD) learning, which uses bootstrapping to estimate the expected return. The `critic_update` function is responsible for:

1. Computing the TD errors based on the current critic's estimates
2. Using these errors to compute a loss function
3. Computing gradients of the loss with respect to the critic parameters
4. Applying gradient clipping to improve training stability
5. Updating the critic parameters using an optimizer
6. Returning the updated parameters and relevant metrics

The critic update is one of the most critical components of SAC, as it drives both the actor's learning (by providing Q-value estimates) and the prioritization of experiences in the replay buffer (via TD errors).

## The Critic Update Function

### Mathematical Foundation

The critic update in SAC is based on the TD learning approach. For a batch of transitions (s, a, r, s', a'), the critic computes the TD target:

$$Q_{target} = r + \gamma \cdot (1 - done) \cdot (\min(Q_1(s', a'), Q_2(s', a')) - \alpha \cdot \log \pi(a'|s'))$$

Where:
- $r$ is the reward
- $\gamma$ is the discount factor
- $done$ is a binary flag indicating a terminal state
- $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the outputs of the double critic network
- $\alpha$ is the temperature parameter (controlling exploration)
- $\log \pi(a'|s')$ is the log probability of the next action under the policy

The TD error for each transition is:

$$TD_{error} = \frac{1}{2}[(Q_{target} - Q_1(s, a))^2 + (Q_{target} - Q_2(s, a))^2]$$

The overall loss is the weighted mean of these TD errors:

$$Loss = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \cdot TD_{error_i}$$

Where $w_i$ are the importance weights from the prioritised experience replay buffer.

### Implementation

The `critic_update` function implements this mathematical foundation:

```python
def critic_update(critic_optimiser,
                  calculate_td_error_fcn : Callable,
                  critic_params : jnp.ndarray,
                  critic_opt_state : jnp.ndarray,
                  critic_grad_max_norm : float,
                  buffer_weights : jnp.ndarray,
                  states : jnp.ndarray,
                  actions : jnp.ndarray,
                  rewards : jnp.ndarray,
                  next_states : jnp.ndarray,
                  dones : jnp.ndarray,
                  temperature : float,
                  critic_target_params : jnp.ndarray,
                  next_actions : jnp.ndarray,
                  next_log_policy : jnp.ndarray) -> Tuple[jnp.ndarray, jnp.ndarray, jnp.ndarray, jnp.ndarray]:
    def loss_fcn(params):
        td_errors = calculate_td_error_fcn(states = jax.lax.stop_gradient(states),
                                           actions = jax.lax.stop_gradient(actions),
                                           rewards = jax.lax.stop_gradient(rewards),
                                           next_states = jax.lax.stop_gradient(next_states),
                                           dones = jax.lax.stop_gradient(dones),
                                           temperature = jax.lax.stop_gradient(temperature),
                                           critic_params = params,
                                           critic_target_params = jax.lax.stop_gradient(critic_target_params),
                                           next_actions = jax.lax.stop_gradient(next_actions),
                                           next_log_policy = jax.lax.stop_gradient(next_log_policy))
        weighted_td_error_loss = jnp.mean(jax.lax.stop_gradient(buffer_weights) * td_errors)
        return weighted_td_error_loss, td_errors

    grads, _ = jax.grad(loss_fcn, has_aux=True)(critic_params)
    clipped_grads = clip_grads(grads, max_norm=critic_grad_max_norm)
    updates, critic_opt_state = critic_optimiser.update(clipped_grads, critic_opt_state, critic_params)
    critic_params = optax.apply_updates(critic_params, updates)
    critic_loss, td_errors = loss_fcn(critic_params)
    return critic_params, critic_opt_state, critic_loss, td_errors
```

### Key Aspects

1. **Stop Gradients**: The function uses `jax.lax.stop_gradient` extensively to prevent gradient computation through certain paths. This ensures that only the critic parameters being updated are differentiated.

2. **Gradient Clipping**: Gradients are clipped to a maximum norm to prevent large parameter updates that could destabilize training.

3. **Weighted Loss**: The TD errors are weighted by the buffer weights, allowing prioritised experience replay to emphasize more important transitions.

4. **Return Values**: The function returns:
   - Updated critic parameters
   - Updated optimizer state
   - The critic loss value (scalar)
   - The TD errors for each transition (used to update priorities in the replay buffer)

## Verification Tests

To ensure the `critic_update` function works correctly, we've implemented three verification tests that check different aspects of its functionality:

### Basic Functionality Test

The basic functionality test (`test_critic_update_basic`) verifies that:

1. The function executes without errors
2. The optimizer state is properly updated
3. The critic parameters change after the update
4. The returned loss is a scalar value
5. The returned TD errors have the correct shape (matching the batch size)

This test also explores how different learning rates affect the critic loss, which helps understand the optimization process. We use learning rates ranging from 1e-4 to 3e-3, which are typical values for Adam optimization in RL.

### Gradient Clipping Test

The gradient clipping test (`test_critic_update_gradient_clipping`) verifies that:

1. Different gradient clipping norms result in different loss values
2. The loss varies predictably with different clipping norms

This test is important because gradient clipping is a key stability mechanism in SAC, especially when dealing with high-variance rewards or complex environments. The test uses a range of clipping norms from very restrictive (0.1) to very permissive (1000.0) to ensure the clipping mechanism functions properly.

### Buffer Weights Test

The buffer weights test (`test_critic_update_buffer_weights`) verifies that:

1. Zero weights result in zero loss (as expected)
2. TD errors are calculated independently of buffer weights
3. Non-uniform weights produce different losses than uniform weights

This test ensures that the prioritised experience replay mechanism works correctly with the critic update. It directly validates that:

- The TD error calculation itself is invariant to buffer weights (a key property that ensures correct error calculation)
- Only the weighted loss is affected by buffer weights, allowing proper prioritization without distorting error estimates
- Setting buffer weights to zero correctly results in zero loss (a mathematical validation)

The test is carefully designed to isolate the effect of buffer weights by ensuring other variables (like network parameters) remain constant when examining TD error invariance.

## Test Results Analysis

All verification tests for the `critic_update` function now pass successfully, indicating robust and correct implementation. The key findings from our tests include:

### Basic Functionality Results
- The critic parameters correctly update during training
- The optimizer state updates as expected
- The loss is properly calculated as a scalar value
- TD errors match the expected batch shape

### Gradient Clipping Results
- Different gradient clipping norms result in measurably different losses
- The loss variation follows expected patterns with respect to clipping norm
- The clipping mechanism effectively constrains gradient magnitudes

### Buffer Weights Results
- Zero buffer weights properly result in zero loss
- TD errors are calculated independently of buffer weights, confirming the mathematical integrity of our TD error calculation
- Different weight distributions appropriately affect the loss function

Previously, the buffer weights test was failing because the test wasn't properly isolating the TD error calculation. We fixed this by carefully separating the TD error computation from the parameter update process and ensuring that the same parameters were used when comparing TD errors across different weight configurations.

## Running the Verification Tests

The verification tests are implemented in `src/agents/functions/verification/critic_update_verification.py`. To run the tests:

```bash
python src/agents/functions/verification/critic_update_verification.py
```

The tests will:
1. Execute all verification checks for the critic_update function
2. Generate visualization plots in the `results/verification/critic_update_verification/` directory
3. Save a CSV file with the test results
4. Display a summary of passing and failing tests

## Conclusion

The `critic_update` function is a crucial component of our SAC implementation, responsible for learning the Q-function that guides policy improvement. Our verification tests confirm that:

1. The function correctly updates the critic parameters using TD learning
2. Gradient clipping works as expected to maintain training stability
3. Buffer weights properly influence the loss calculation while maintaining TD error integrity, enabling correct prioritised experience replay

The successful completion of all tests indicates that our critic update function is mathematically sound and implemented correctly, which is essential for the overall performance and reliability of the SAC algorithm.

The fixed buffer weights test is particularly important as it ensures the correctness of prioritised experience replay, which is a key enhancement to the basic SAC algorithm. By verifying that TD errors remain independent of the weighting process, we've confirmed that our implementation maintains the mathematical principles of TD learning while benefiting from prioritised sampling.
